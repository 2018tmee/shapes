# shapes

Shapes is a Python package for traditional and geometric morphometrics.

It can be used in a Python interpretator, or in a GUI online at [PhyloNimbus.com](http://www.phylonimbus.com/morphometrics/), where you can also digitize landmarks.

Uses include:

* Procrustes superimposition.
* Missing landmark estimation.
